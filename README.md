# Green-Ampt
Based on the fortran code of J.E. Parsons and R. Mu√±oz-Carpena (provided in: http://abe.ufl.edu/carpena/software/wingampt.shtml). Same as their progam, the code submitted here follows the method of Chu (1978), Mein and Larson (1971, 1973) and Skaggs and Kaheel (1982) to calculate infiltration for unsteady rainfall using the Green-Ampt equation.
